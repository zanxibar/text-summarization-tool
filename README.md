# text-summarization-tool

A text summarization tool built using Hugging Face Transformers and Gradio. This tool generates concise summaries of long texts using state-of-the-art NLP models like BART and T5. The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook for easy experimentation and deployment.

### Features
Abstractive Summarization: Generates new sentences that capture the essence of the original text.

Customizable Summary Length: Adjust the max_length and min_length parameters to control the summary size.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Gradio for easy interaction.

Pre-trained Models: Uses Hugging Face's facebook/bart-large-cnn model for high-quality summaries.
